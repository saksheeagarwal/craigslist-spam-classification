# Craigslist Spam Classification

Aligning with the vision of Craigslist, we have created an authentication categorisation model which could help Craigslist in giving the users an enriched experience on the website keeping everything simple. As the False negatives are more harmful for the company, we decided on evaluating the model on precision.

## Project Objectives
- To create a model to filter spam advertisements
- Applying Data analysis concepts to solve the problem
- Enrich the user experience
